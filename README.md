# Nirvana

What do Japanese artisans, engineers, Zen philosophy, and cuisine have in common ? Simplicity and attention to detail. It is not just lazy simplicity but a sophisticated one that searches out new frontiers, always taking the object, the body and mind, or cuisine to the next level, according to ones Ikigai. The Japanese are skilled at bringing nature and technology togetherâ€” not man vs nature, but rather a union of the two. Meditation generates alpha and theta brain waves right away. It may take half an hour for a beginner to experience them, these relaxing brainwaves are the ones that are activated right before we fall asleep, as we lie in the sun, or right after taking a hot bath. At the root of all our thoughts, emotions and behaviours is the communication between neurons within our brains. Brainwaves are produced by synchronised electrical pulses from masses of neurons communicating with each other.

**Nirvana is an interactive app designed to help users achieve deep meditative states by allowing them to visualize their brainwaves using an OpenBCI Ganglion board.** OpenBCI specializes in creating low-cost, high-quality biosensing hardware for brain computer interfacing. Their arduino compatible biosensing boards provide high resolution imaging and recording of EMG, ECG, and EEG signals.
